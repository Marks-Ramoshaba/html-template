      <strong>Practical Guidelines for <h1 class="greeting">Novice Teachers</h1>
      </strong>
  </h1>
  

    <p>The day-to-day complexities of teaching in South African <em>classrooms</em> are particularly challenging 
for novice teachers. Although equipped with knowledge and competencies from their years of 
study, often there is a gap between what new teachers know and how to apply that knowledge 
in a ‘real’ classroom.
  </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Teaching as a career in South Africa — what does it really entail?</li>
<li>You as a new professional — what does this mean, how does it change your identity and 
how do you look after yourself.</li>
        <li>Diverse learners — how to deal with differing learning styles, temperaments and 
behaviours in one classroom.</li>
<li>Classroom matters — from surviving the 1st day to making your own inexpensive 
  resources.</li>
<li>Extracurricular activities — from coaching to organising a school function.
</li>
    </ul>
